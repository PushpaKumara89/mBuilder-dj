                            complete the works in question. Each item identified above has corresponding detailed
                            information contained within MBuild and can be reviewed via

                            has communicated the necessity for the sub-contractor to submit a proposal for testing and
                            rectification prior to undertaking any further works, the subcontractor must submit this
                            proposal to Multiplex in Aconex, referencing the rework ID. The proposal must be submitted
                            for approval within the same timeframe.
